I am a PhD student at  Beijing jiaotong University, advised by Profs. [Weiwei Xing](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/7930/).

My research interests lie in machine learning and causal inference. Most recently, I have been working on causal representation learning, aiming to uncover latent structures and climate from saptial-temproal data.

Previously, I obtained my master's degree from [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (CQUPT)](https://www.cqupt.edu.cn/) and bachelor's degree also from [CQUPT](https://www.cqupt.edu.cn/). During my study, I have spent time at [AntGroup](https://www.antgroup.com/).
